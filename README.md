# Spam Filtering

The aim of the project is to create software which will give us a basic idea of how a spam filtering actually works in our everyday life and how we practically apply it. When we talk about Spam, we generally mean emails, SMS, chats, phone calls, etc. So a spam is one which is sent to you as an email promotion, bulk mail or, simply irrelevant or unsolicited messages typically for the purpose of advertisement, virus, phishing, etc. And in most of the cases you are not interested in receiving them. So to solve this problem we had to go through the mail and identify if itâ€™s a spam or not. A mail which is not spam (is called ham), we keep in Inbox and for the spam, and we manually used to move it to a junk folder. Now that is a lot of work to do, given that these days a huge amount of mails are spam and they waste our time and space. We can use the software that we are trying to build to assist us to filter out the spams, and help make our task easy in everyday life.
